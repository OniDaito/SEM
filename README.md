# SEM ROMs from HacDC

A collection of ROM dumps from the HacDC Scanning Electron Microscope.

For a more complete writeup, see [https://benjamin.computer/posts/2018-04-05-rom-reading.html](https://benjamin.computer/posts/2018-04-05-rom-reading.html)

This project includes an Arduino .ino project file for an Arduino Mega that will read the ROM itself.

The python convert.py script runs with Python3 and converts an ascii hex dump file from the arduino project to a binary file.
